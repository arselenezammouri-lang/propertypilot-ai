Hi! I want to upgrade the main landing page (app/page.tsx) to a dual-focus, enterprise-grade landing for PropertyPilot AI: USA + International.

Please DO NOT touch pricing (/pricing), demo (/demo), auth routes, CRM, or Stripe logic.
Only work on:

app/page.tsx (main landing)

SEO meta for the home page if needed (title/description/json-ld)

Optional small updates in app/layout.tsx only for meta tags (no routing changes)

Keep the current dark, premium style and brand name:

PropertyPilot AI – Pilot Your Agency to the Next Level

🎯 GOAL

Turn the home page into a world-class SaaS landing, inspired by HubSpot / KVCore / Zillow:

Hero in ENGLISH, focused on US real estate agents

All copy in English by default (we will keep Italian for pricing/demo etc.)

Highlight that the tool works globally (Europe, LATAM, etc.)

Show that the product is trusted by agents in 12+ countries

🧩 SECTION STRUCTURE (NEW LANDING)

Please rework app/page.tsx with this structure:

1) HERO SECTION (USA + Global)

Big headline (H1):

The AI Operating System for Real Estate Agencies

Sub-headline:

Close more deals, write better listings, and automate follow-ups.
Built for agents and teams in the US, Europe, and beyond.

Above headline badge (small pill):

Built for Real Estate • Powered by GPT-4

CTAs (side-by-side):

Primary: Start Free → links to /auth/signup

Secondary: Book a Demo → links to /demo

Under the CTAs, add a tiny line:

“Also available in Italian and 12+ languages for your listings.”

On the right side (or below on mobile) show a nice dashboard screenshot (use existing dashboard UI) inside a blurred/glass card with a subtle glow.

2) SOCIAL PROOF STRIP

Just below the hero, add a strip like:

Trusted by agents and agencies in 12+ countries

Then a row of logo placeholders (we can use simple text logos for now):

Keller Williams

RE/MAX

Century 21

Coldwell Banker

eXp Realty

Immobiliare.it

Idealista

(Use low-key opacity so they look like “trusted by” logos, not real partnerships.)

3) “WHY PROPERTYPILOT AI” – 3 PILLARS

Create a section with 3 big cards (responsive grid):

Pillar 1 – AI Listing Engine

Text example:

Write perfect MLS & Zillow-ready listings in seconds.
Titles, descriptions, hashtags, video scripts, and luxury PDF brochures.

Pillar 2 – CRM & Automation Engine

Visual pipelines, lead scoring, automated follow-ups via email, SMS, and WhatsApp.

Pillar 3 – Global & Multi-Language

Listings and marketing content in 12+ languages.
Perfect for cross-border clients, expats, and international investors.

Each card should have:

An icon (you can reuse existing icons: pen, workflow, globe, etc.)

Short bullet list (2–3 bullets)

Light gradient backgrounds (stay consistent with current theme)

4) FEATURE DEEP DIVE – 3 SECTIONS

Create a three-step vertical section with a left-right layout (image + text):

4.1 – Listing Suite Pro

Bullets:

AI titles A/B tested for high CTR

Descriptions optimized for MLS & portals (Zillow, Immobiliare, Idealista, etc.)

Brochures and luxury PDF templates included

4.2 – CRM & Pipeline for Real Estate

Bullets:

Kanban pipeline for New / Contacted / Follow-Up / Closed / Lost

Lead notes, history, and scoring (Hot / Warm / Cold)

Smart automations: change status, assign, send follow-up email/SMS

4.3 – Communication Hub

Bullets:

Email, SMS, WhatsApp from one place

AI-generated scripts with tones: professional, luxury, emotional, urgent

Full history of messages per lead

Use our existing screenshots (CRM / pipeline / communication hub) or simple UI mockups with gradients.

5) “BUILT FOR AGENTS & TEAMS” (ENTERPRISE-STYLE)

Create a section with two columns:

Left side title:

For solo agents, small teams, and growing agencies

Left bullet list:

Solo agents: get a personal AI assistant for every listing

Teams: share leads, notes, and automations in one workspace

Agencies: manage up to 10+ agents with roles and reporting

Right side: a highlighted card for Agency & Teams:

Small badge: For Teams & Brokerages

Bullets:

Lead routing and assignment rules

Multi-agent activity reports

White-label PDFs and branding

Priority support

Add a CTA button inside this card:

Book an Agency Demo → /demo

6) GLOBAL MAP / INTERNATIONAL SECTION

Short section emphasizing global reach:

Title:

From Milan to Miami: one platform for global real estate

Bullets (simple grid with flags icons):

🇺🇸 US & Canada – MLS & Zillow-style listings

🇮🇹 Italy – Immobiliare.it, Casa.it, Idealista

🇪🇸 Spain & 🇵🇹 Portugal – international buyers & investors

🌍 Dubai, France, UK, LATAM – 12+ languages for your listings

Small note:

“PropertyPilot AI is already used by agents in multiple countries. We’re ready for your market.”

7) PRICING PREVIEW (SYNCHRONIZED WITH /PRICING)

Create a shorter “Plans overview” section (do NOT change prices or links, just summarize):

Cards for Starter, Pro, Agency, Agency Boost with:

Same prices as /pricing

One-line description each

Button:

Starter: Start Free → /auth/signup

Pro: See Pro plan details → /pricing (anchor to Pro)

Agency: Book Agency Demo → /demo

Boost: Agency Boost: one-time setup → /pricing or /demo

8) “HOW IT WORKS” – 3 STEPS

Small section:

Create your account – Start free, no credit card required

Connect your leads & listings – Import or paste your existing content

Let AI do the heavy lifting – Listings, follow-ups, and CRM in one place

Include a simple CTA:

Start Free in 2 Minutes → /auth/signup

9) TESTIMONIALS

Replace or extend current testimonials with international flavor (placeholders are fine):

US Realtor

Italian agent

French or Spanish agent

Each testimonial: 1–2 sentences, 5 stars icons, role + country flag.

10) FINAL CTA + FOOTER

At the bottom, a strong final CTA block:

Title:

Ready to upgrade your real estate business with AI?

Buttons:

Start Free → /auth/signup

Book a 1:1 Demo → /demo

Below, keep the existing footer (Terms, Privacy, Refund, etc.) but ensure there is a visible link:

Demo

Pricing

Login

Start Free

🎨 DESIGN & TECH REQUIREMENTS

Keep the current dark theme and general style (gradients, neon, glow).

Make all new sections fully responsive (mobile-first).

Don’t introduce any new libraries; use existing components (buttons, cards, badges, etc.).

Keep text mainly in English, but it’s ok to keep some Italian where already present in other pages.

Don’t break any existing routes, API calls, or Stripe / Supabase logic.

When you’re done, please:

Run the app and test:

/ (home)

/pricing

/demo

/auth/login and /auth/signup

Confirm there are no TypeScript errors.

Confirm all CTAs navigate correctly.

Then send me a short summary of what you changed in app/page.tsx and/or layout metadata.

Grazie!
