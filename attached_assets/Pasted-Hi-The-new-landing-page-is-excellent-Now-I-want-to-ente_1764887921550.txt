Hi! The new landing page is excellent. Now I want to enter Phase 2: OPTIMIZATION for Global Launch.
Please complete the following 8 tasks, working ONLY inside app/page.tsx, app/layout.tsx, and /public if needed.

🔧 TASK 1 — Improve Hero Section Visual Impact

Please:

Increase H1 size by +10–15%

Add a subtle animated gradient on the headline (premium SaaS style)

Add a small glow behind the dashboard mockup

Smooth entrance animations (fade-up + slight scale)

Use framer-motion if already available; if not, use minimal CSS animations.

🔧 TASK 2 — Replace Placeholder Logos with Neutral Vector Logos

Add clean, neutral SVG logos in the Social Proof Strip:

Keller Williams

RE/MAX

Century 21

eXp Realty

Coldwell Banker

Immobiliare.it

Idealista

Use simple monochrome SVG icons in /public/logos/ (or inline if easier).
Do NOT claim real partnership; keep low-opacity.

🔧 TASK 3 — Improve the 3 Pillars Section

For the 3 pillars (“AI Listing Engine”, “CRM & Automation Engine”, “Global & Multi-Language”):

Add subtle background gradients

Add icon animations on hover

Increase spacing on mobile

Add small bullet icons (checkmarks or sparkles)

🔧 TASK 4 — Polish Deep-Dive Sections

For the 3 deep-dive sections:

Add alternating background stripes

Add smooth fade-left / fade-right animations

Make images/screenshots slightly rounded with shadow

Ensure perfect mobile stacking

🔧 TASK 5 — Improve International Section

In the “From Milan to Miami” section:

Add a soft glowing world map silhouette in the background

Add flag emojis as icons next to each bullet

Improve section spacing for desktop

🔧 TASK 6 — Pricing Preview UI Enhancements

Do NOT change pricing or Stripe logic.
Only improve the preview blocks by:

Adding a soft border

Improving CTA button size

Adding a small highlight to the Pro plan (“Most Popular” badge)

🔧 TASK 7 — Testimonials Upgrade

Please:

Add rounded cards

Add soft gradients (same style as landing)

Add flag icons for each reviewer

Light fade-in animation

Add a 4th testimonial (English, US agent)

Keep everything anonymous (first name only)

🔧 TASK 8 — Final Call to Action Section

Strengthen the final CTA:

Larger headline

Brighter gradient button for Start Free

Add small trust badges:

“No credit card required”

“Cancel anytime”

“Trusted by agents in 12+ countries”

All elements must stay visually consistent with the current brand identity.

🧪 After finishing, please run the following checks:

Home page loads with no layout shifts

All animations run smoothly

Mobile layout tested at <500px

No TypeScript errors

No warnings in console

Then give me a summary of what was changed.

Thanks!
