Subject: Request for Full Technical Review Before Live Launch (High-Scale SaaS Project)

Hi Replit Team,
I hope you're doing well.

I'm building a high-scale SaaS on Replit (https://propertycopypro.replit.app
).
My goal is to launch a professional platform in the real-estate automation niche and scale it progressively to 5K–10K€/week in revenue.

Before switching Stripe to LIVE mode and starting real payments, I want to ensure that everything has been properly configured at a production-ready level.

🔍 1. Stripe Integration – Verification Before Live Mode

I kindly ask you to check:

correct setup of test keys

correct loading of the webhook secret (/api/webhook)

correct behavior of billing and subscription flow

readiness of the code for LIVE mode (no missing environment variables)

🔍 2. Environment Variables & Secrets

Please verify:

all secrets are correctly loaded in Replit

no missing keys

no duplicated or unused environment variables

secure handling of private keys

🔍 3. Backend API Stability

Please review the stability and correctness of the following routes:

/api/generate

/api/checkout or /api/upgrade

/api/webhook

/api/user

This SaaS will serve real clients globally, so reliability is essential.

🔍 4. Deployment & Performance

Before going LIVE, I want to ensure my deployment is production-ready.
Please check for:

cold start issues

performance bottlenecks

memory or timeout risks

server instance reliability

🔍 5. Code Quality & Scalability Suggestions

This SaaS is only at the first stage.
We plan to add major features soon:

HD AI Image Generator

Real-Estate AI Chat Assistant

Direct Listing Publishing Automation

Other advanced tools
Each feature will increase scale and traffic.

If you have any suggestions to improve:

structure

security

scalability

code best practices

…your feedback is highly appreciated.

I want this product to reach the highest professional standard before launching publicly.
Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,
Arselene Zammouri
