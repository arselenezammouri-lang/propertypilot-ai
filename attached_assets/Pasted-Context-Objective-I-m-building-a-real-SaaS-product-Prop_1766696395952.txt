Context & Objective
I’m building a real SaaS product (PropertyPilot AI) with the explicit goal of turning it into a scalable, revenue-generating business (not a demo or side project).
I need a clear technical and business-level assessment of the current state of the product to understand its real value, current limits, and scalability potential.

1️⃣ CURRENT TECHNICAL STATE (REQUESTED ANALYSIS)
Please provide a precise technical snapshot of the SaaS, including:

Current architecture (frontend, backend, database, auth, payments)

Stripe integration status (checkout, subscriptions, webhooks, sync logic)

Supabase usage (tables, relations, subscription state, data integrity)

Current automation level (manual steps vs fully automated)

Security level (auth, subscription validation, access control)

Stability risks or architectural bottlenecks

I want to clearly know what works, what is fragile, and what is production-ready.

2️⃣ FEATURE & PRODUCT DEPTH ANALYSIS
Please list:

All existing features (user-facing and backend)

Which features are “MVP-grade” vs “enterprise-grade”

What’s missing for a SaaS that can realistically charge €297–€497+/month

Which features actually drive retention and MRR

I want to understand whether the product is currently:

a basic MVP

a solid early-stage SaaS

or already close to a premium SaaS

3️⃣ SCALABILITY & MONEY MECHANICS
I need real numbers, not motivation:

Can this architecture support 100, 1,000, 10,000 users?

Where would it break first (DB, Stripe, API calls, AI costs)?

Estimated cost per user (AI, infra, DB, APIs)

Break-even points at different price tiers

4️⃣ MONETIZATION REALITY CHECK
Based on the current product:

What pricing tiers are realistically justified today?

What additional features are REQUIRED to justify:

€297/month

€497/month

Agency / enterprise pricing

I want a brutally honest evaluation, even if the answer is “not ready yet”.

5️⃣ PATH TO A “MONEY MACHINE” SaaS
Finally, give me:

A prioritized roadmap (technical + product)

The MINIMUM upgrades required to reach:

€10k/month

€50k/month

€100k+/month

Focus on leverage, automation, and compounding value, not complexity.

Important note
My goal is not to “learn to code”, but to build a scalable SaaS business.
I’m fine delegating or automating technical complexity, but I need absolute clarity on where the product stands and what it can realistically become.

Thank you — I expect a direct, structured, and honest response.
